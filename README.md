# GAIDLP-BUSINESS-ANALYSIS-PROJECT
This project focuses on predicting flood probabilities using various environmental and infrastructural features, such as Monsoon Intensity, Topography Drainage, River Management, Climate Change, Deforestation, and more. The dataset has undergone multiple statistical analyses (ANOVA, Regression, Decision Tree) to identify key variables contributing to flood risk.

Key Features:
Dataset: Contains various factors like Monsoon Intensity, Climate Change, Urbanization, Drainage Systems, and others related to flood prediction.
Statistical Analysis: Performed ANOVA, OLS Regression, Decision Tree, and Sensitivity Analysis to understand the significance and impact of each feature.
Machine Learning Models: Built a deep learning neural network model for accurate flood prediction based on the processed data.
Streamlit Dashboard: An interactive dashboard for visualizing predictions and insights, allowing users to explore the modelâ€™s behavior under different scenarios.
Technologies Used:
Python: For data analysis and model development
Scikit-learn: For regression, decision tree, and sensitivity analysis
TensorFlow/Keras: For building the deep learning neural network model
Streamlit: For creating the interactive dashboard
Pandas, NumPy: For data manipulation and processing
Results:
The model predicts flood probabilities with significant accuracy, and the Streamlit dashboard offers users an interactive way to explore the impacts of different variables on flood risks.
